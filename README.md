git skills learned  
git init  
git status  
git add <filename> or . for everything  
git commit -m "message"  
git push  
git branch (check what branch you are on)  
git fetch (remote all branches -> local) / git pull (remote current branch -> local)  
git config --list (for the username and email on the commits)  
git log (for commit history)  

git push origin --delete {branch name} (delete a remote branch)  
git diff (review changes before committing them)  
git stash (save changes but not commit them / green is staged file, red is not staged file. File must be staged to push)  
git stash pop (most recent commit pulls to local)
git stash list , then git stash apply ...  
git cherry-pick  
git checkout -b <name> (create new local branch)  
git checkout <branch> (local will pull the input branch from remote)  
git rebase (put current change puts it above the remote change, important for when multiple ppl work on the same branch)  
git merge
